Download the swc from

http://github.com/specialunderwear/robotlegs-dungdungdung/downloads

and drop it your *lib* directory.

You also need to have the swiftsuspenders swc from

http://github.com/tschneidereit/SwiftSuspenders

because that is what dungdungdung uses.

You can also build from source, to do that, clone the repository at:
git@github.com:specialunderwear/robotlegs-dungdungdung.git

Then cd into the robotlegs-dungdungdung directory and type:

make

You will find an swc, a test suite and asdocs being build into the

bin

and

docs

directories.
